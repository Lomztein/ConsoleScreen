# Console Screen
 - Written by Marcus "Lomztein" Jensen
 
ConsoleScreen is likely the single most useless piece of software in existance. Its sole purpose is to render customized 3D models into a conole window.
 
Any code in here can be borrowed, and used for whatever you want really. I mean, it's not like I spent hundreds of hours writing this, more like 4 hours. #humblebrag
 
To use this software, open the ConsoleScreen.exe file found within the Compiled folder.
 - 1: The software asks for a model. Write in the complete path of one found in the Models folder.
 - 2: The software asks for a scale. Models are typically 1 to 2 units high, and one unit is equal to two characters horizontally, by one character vertically. The screen size by default is 40 units.
 - A model should now appear of whatever you chose.
  
You can easily create your own models. Do note that the program renders the edges between polygons, instead of the faces like standard rendering. Due to this, models do not need to be triangulized, and for the best result should only have edges where lines should display in the software.
  
Hopefully I wrote that understandably. Chances are I didn't.
  
Have fun! :D
